== Purpose

The `lutaml-hal` gem provides a framework for interacting with HAL-compliant
APIs using the power of LutaML Models.

Hypertext Application Language (HAL)
(https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kelly-json-hal-11.html[HAL Internet-Draft])
is a simple format for representing
resources and their relationships in a hypermedia-driven API.

It allows clients to navigate and interact with resources using links, making it
easier to build flexible and extensible applications.

This library provides a set of classes and methods for modeling HAL resources,
links, and collections, as well as a client for making HTTP requests to HAL
APIs.

== Features

* Classes for modeling HAL resources and links
* A client for making HTTP requests to HAL APIs
* Tools for pagination and resource resolution
* Integration with the `lutaml-model` serialization framework
* Error handling and response validation for API interactions


== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'lutaml-hal'
----

And then execute:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install lutaml-hal
----

== Structure

The classes in this library are organized into the following modules:

`Lutaml::Hal::Client`::
A client for making HTTP requests to HAL APIs. It includes methods for setting
the API endpoint, making GET requests, and handling responses.
+
NOTE: Only GET requests are supported at the moment.

`Lutaml::Hal::ModelRegister`::
A registry for managing HAL resource models and their endpoints. It allows you
to register models, define their relationships, and fetch resources from the
API.

`Lutaml::Hal::GlobalRegister`::
A global registry (Singleton) for managing ModelRegisters and facilitating model
resolution across different resources. Its usage is optional.

`Lutaml::Hal::Resource`::
A base class for defining HAL resource models. It includes methods for
defining attributes, links, and key-value mappings for resources.

`Lutaml::Hal::Link`::
A class for defining HAL links. It includes methods for specifying the
relationship between resources and their links, as well as methods for
resolving links to their target resources.

`Lutaml::Hal::Page`::
A class for handling pagination in HAL APIs. It includes methods for
defining pagination attributes, such as `page`, `pages`, `limit`, and
`total`, as well as methods for accessing linked resources within a page.


== Usage overview

In order to interact with a HAL API using `lutaml-hal`, there are two
stages of usage: data definition and runtime.

At the data definition phase:

. Define the API endpoint using the `Client` class.
. Create a `ModelRegister` to manage the resource models and their
respective endpoints.
. (optional) Create a `GlobalRegister` to manage one or more `ModelRegister`
  instances. It is necessary for automatic Link resolution.
. Define the resource models using the `Resource` class.
. Register the models with the `ModelRegister` and define their
relationships using the `add_endpoint` method.

Once data definition is present, the following operations can be performed at
runtime:

. Fetch resources from the API using the `ModelRegister` and `Link#realize` methods.

.. Once the resources are fetched, you can access their attributes and links
and navigate through the resource graph.

. Pagination, such as on "index" type pages, can be handled by subclassing the `Page` class.
+
NOTE: The `Page` class itself is also implemented as a `Resource`, so you can
use the same methods to access the page's attributes and links.


== Usage: Data definition

=== General

HAL resources need to be defined as models to allow data access and serialization.

The following steps are required:

. Define HAL resource models.
. Define the base API URL using the `Client` class.
. Create a `ModelRegister` to manage the resource models.
. Define the resource models' respective endpoints on the base API URL.


=== Creating a HAL model register

The `ModelRegister` class is used to manage the resource models and their
respective endpoints on the base API URL.

It relies on the `Client` class to perform HTTP requests to the API. The base
API URL is defined at the `Client` object.

NOTE: The base API URL is used for all requests made by the `Client` class,
including the requests made by the `ModelRegister` class.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'lutaml-hal'

# Create a new client with API endpoint
client = Lutaml::Hal::Client.new(api_url: 'https://api.example.com')
register = Lutaml::Hal::ModelRegister.new(name: :my_model_register, client: client)
# Or set client later, `register.client = client`
----

The `name:` parameter is used to identify the `ModelRegister` instance.

=== Creating a HAL global register

The `GlobalRegister` class is a singleton that manages one or more
`ModelRegister` instances.

It is optional, but is required for automatic realization of models from Link
objects. See <<fetching_resource_via_link_realization>> for more details.

[source,ruby]
----
require 'lutaml-hal'

# Create a new client with API endpoint
client = Lutaml::Hal::Client.new(api_url: 'https://api.example.com')
register = Lutaml::Hal::ModelRegister.new(name: :my_model_register, client: client)

# Register the ModelRegister with the global register
global_register = Lutaml::Hal::GlobalRegister.instance.register(:my_model_register, register)

# Obtain the global register
global_register.get(:my_model_register)

# Delete a register mapping
global_register.delete(:my_model_register)
----


=== Defining HAL resource models

==== General

A HAL resource is defined by creating a subclass of the `Resource` class and
defining its attributes, links, and key-value mappings.

The `Resource` class is the base class for defining HAL resource models.
It inherits from `Lutaml::Model::Serializable`, which provides data
modelling and serialization capabilities.

The declaration of attributes, links, and key-value mappings for a HAL resource
is performed using the `attribute`, `hal_link`, and `key_value` methods.

There are 3 levels of data modeling in a HAL resource, all of which are necessary
for the full usage of a HAL resource:

* Resource attributes
* Serialization mappings
* HAL Links


.Integrated example of a resource model
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  class Product < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :id, :string
    attribute :name, :string
    attribute :price, :float

    hal_link :self, key: 'self', realize_class: 'Product'
    hal_link :category, key: 'category', realize_class: 'Category'

    key_value do
      map 'id', to: :id
      map 'name', to: :name
      map 'price', to: :price
    end
  end
end
----
====


==== Resource attributes

A resource attribute is a direct property of the HAL resource.

These attributes typically hold values of simple data types, and are directly
serialized into JSON.

These attributes are declared using the `attribute` method from `lutaml-model`.

[example]
====
A HAL resource of class `Product` can have attributes `id`, `name`, and `price`.
====

Please refer to syntax as described in the
https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml-model[`lutaml-model`] documentation.

.Example of a resource model with attributes
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  class Product < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :id, :string
    attribute :name, :string
    attribute :price, :float
    # ...
  end
end
----
====

==== Serialization mapping of resource attributes

A serialization mapping defines rules to serialize a HAL resource to and from a
serialization format. In HAL, the serialization format is JSON, but other formats
can also be supported.

The mapping between the HAL model attributes and their corresponding JSON
serialization is performed using the `key_value do` or `json do` blocks from
`lutaml-model`. The mapping of the contents of `_links` is automatically
performed using `hal_link`.

[example]
====
A HAL resource of class `Product` with attributes `id`, `name`, and `price` will
need to declare a `key_value` block to map the attributes to their corresponding
JSON keys, namely, `"id"`, `"name"`, and `"price"`.
====

Please refer to syntax as described in the
https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml-model[`lutaml-model`] documentation.

.Example of a resource model with serialization mapping
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  class Product < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :id, :string
    attribute :name, :string
    attribute :price, :float

    key_value do
      map 'id', to: :id
      map 'name', to: :name
      map 'price', to: :price
    end
  end
end
----
====



==== HAL Links

A HAL resource has links to other resources, typically serialized in
the `_links` section of the JSON response.

[example]
====
A HAL resource of class `Product` can have links `self` (which is a
self-referential identifier link) and `category`.
====

HAL links need to be defined in the resource model to allow the resolution of
the links to their target resources.

These links are declared using the `hal_link` method provided by `lutaml-hal`.

Syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
hal_link :link_name,
  key: 'link_key',
  realize_class: 'TargetResourceClass',
  link_class: 'LinkClass',
  link_set_class: 'LinkSetClass'
----

`:link_name`:: The name of the link, which will be used to access the link in
the resource object.

`key: 'link_key'`:: The key of the link in the JSON response. This is the name
of the link as it appears in the `_links` section of the HAL resource.

`realize_class: 'TargetResourceClass'`:: The class of the target resource that
the link points to. This is used to resolve the link to the associated resource.

`link_class: 'LinkClass'`:: (optional) The class of the link that defines
specific behavior or attributes for the link object itself. This is dynamically
created and is inherited from `Lutaml::Hal::Link` if not provided.

`link_set_class: 'LinkSetClass'`:: (optional) The class of the link set object
that contains the links. This is dynamically created and is inherited from
`Lutaml::Model::Serializable` if not provided.


The `_links` section is modeled as a dynamically created link set class, named
after the resource's class name (with an appended `LinkSet` string), which in turn
contains the defined links to other resources. The link set class is inherited
from `Lutaml::Model::Serializable`.

[example]
====
A HAL resource of class `Product` may have a link set of class `ProductLinkSet`
which contains the `self` and `category` links as its attributes.
====


Each link object of the link set is provided as a `Link` object that is
dynamically created for the type of resolved resource. The name of the link
class is the same as the resource class name with an appended `Link` string.
This Link class is inherited from `Lutaml::Hal::Link`.

[example]
====
A HAL resource of class `Product` with a link set that contains the `self`
(points to a `Product`) and `category` (points to a `Category`) links will
have:

* a link set of class `ProductLinks` which contains:
** a `self` attribute that is an instance of `ProductLink`
** a `category` attribute that is an instance of `CategoryLink`
====


.Integrated example of a HAL resource model using auto-generated LinkSet and Link classes
[example]
====
For an instance of `Product`:

[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  class Product < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :id, :string
    attribute :name, :string
    attribute :price, :float

    hal_link :self, key: 'self', realize_class: 'Product'
    hal_link :category, key: 'category', realize_class: 'Category'

    key_value do
      map 'id', to: :id
      map 'name', to: :name
      map 'price', to: :price
    end
  end
end
----

The library will provide:

* the link set (serialized in HAL as JSON `_links`) in the class `ProductLinks`.

* the link set contains the `self` and the `category` links of class `Lutaml::Hal::Link`.

As a result:

* calling `product.links.self` will return an instance of `ProductLink`.

* calling `product.links.self.realize(register)` will dynamically fetch and
return an instance of `Product`.
====



==== Custom link set class

When a custom link set class (via `link_set_class:`) is provided, links are no
longer automatically added to the link set via `hal_link`. Please ensure that
all links are defined as model `attributes` and their `key_value` mappings
provided.

This is useful for the scenario where the link set needs to be
customized to provide additional attributes or behavior.

A LinkSetClass for a resource must implement the following interface:

[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  # This represents the link set of a Resource
  class ResourceLinkSet < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
    attribute :attribute_name_1, :link_class_1, collection: {true|false}
    attribute :attribute_name_2, :link_class_2, collection: {true|false}
    # ...

    key_value do
      map 'link_key_1', to: :attribute_name_1
      map 'link_key_2', to: :attribute_name_2
      # ...
    end
  end

  # This represents the basic setup of a Resource with a custom LinkSet class
  class Resource < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :links, ResourceLinkSet
    # Define resource attributes

    key_value do
      # This is the mapping of the `_links` key to the attribute `links`.
      map '_links', to: :links
      # Mappings for resource attributes need to be explicitly provided
    end
  end
end
----

Alternatively, it is possible to re-open the dynamically created link set class
and add additional attributes to it.

.Override the default link set class for Product
[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  class Product < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :id, :string
  end
  # The class `MyApi::ProductLinkSet` is created automatically by the library.

  # Re-open the default link set class and add additional attributes
  class ProductLinkSet < Lutaml::Hal::LinkSet
    # Add additional attributes to the link set
    attribute :custom_link_set_attribute, Something, collection: false

    key_value do
      map 'my_custom_link', to: :custom_link_set_attribute
    end
  end
end
----

==== Custom link class

When a custom link class (via `link_class:`) is provided, the custom link class
is automatically added into the link set.

This makes it possible to:

* supplement the link with additional attributes, or
* override the `realize(register)` method to provide custom behavior for the link.

A Link class pointing to a resource must implement the following interface:

[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  # This represents a link set pointing to a Resource
  class TargetResourceLink < Lutaml::Model::Serializable
    # This is the link class for the resource class Resource
    # 'default:' needs to be set to the name of the target resource class
    attribute :type, :string, default: 'Resource'

    # No specification of key_value block needed since attribute presence
    # provides a default mapping.
  end
end
----

Alternatively, it is possible to re-open the dynamically created link class and add
additional attributes to it.

.Override the default link class for Product
[source,ruby]
----
module MyApi
  class Product < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
    attribute :id, :string
    hal_link :category, key: 'category', realize_class: 'Category'
  end
  # The class `MyApi::CategoryLink` is created automatically by the library.

  # Re-open the default link class and add additional attributes
  class CategoryLink < Lutaml::Hal::Link
    # Add additional attributes to the link
    attribute :language_code, :string, collection: false

    key_value do
      map 'language_code', to: :language_code
    end
  end
end
----



=== Registering resource models and endpoints

The `ModelRegister` allows you to register resource models and their endpoints.

You can define endpoints for collections (index) and individual resources
(resource) using the `add_endpoint` method.

The `add_endpoint` method takes the following parameters:


`id`:: A unique identifier for the endpoint.

`type`:: The type of endpoint, which can be `index` or `resource`.

`url`:: The URL of the endpoint, which can include path parameters.
+
In the `url`, you can use interpolation parameters, which will be replaced with
the actual values when fetching the resource. The interpolation parameters are
defined in the `url` string using curly braces `{}`.

`model`:: The class of the resource that will be fetched from the API.
The class must inherit from `Lutaml::Hal::Resource`.

`query_params`:: (optional) A hash defining query parameters that should be
appended to the URL when fetching the resource. Supports parameter templates
using curly braces `{}` for dynamic values.
+
This is essential for APIs that require query parameters for pagination,
filtering, or other functionality where the same base URL needs different query
parameters to access different resources or views.

The `add_endpoint` method will automatically handle the URL resolution and fetch
the resource from the API.

When the `ModelRegister` fetches a resource using the `realize` method, it will
match the resource URL against registered paths in order to find the
appropriate model class to use for deserialization and resolution.

Syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
register.add_endpoint( <1>
  id: :model_index, <2>
  type: :index, <3>
  url: '/url_supporting_interpolation/{param}', <4>
  model: ModelClass <5>
)
----
<1> The `add_endpoint` method is used to register an endpoint for a model.
<2> The `id` is a unique identifier for the endpoint, which is required to
    fetch the resource later.
<3> The `type` specifies the type of endpoint, which can be `index` or
    `resource`. The `index` type is used for collections, while the
    `resource` type is used for individual resources.
<4> The `url` is the URL of the endpoint, which can include path
    parameters. The URL can also include interpolation parameters, which
    will be replaced with the actual values when fetching the resource.
<5> The `model` is the class of the resource that will be fetched from
    the API. The class must inherit from `Lutaml::Hal::Resource`.


.Example of registering and using query parameters
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# Register an endpoint that supports pagination via query parameters
register.add_endpoint(
  id: :product_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/products',
  model: ProductIndex,
  query_params: {
    'page' => '{page}',
    'items' => '{items}'
  }
)

# Fetch the first page with 10 items per page
page_1 = register.fetch(:product_index, page: 1, items: 10)
# => client.get('/products?page=1&items=10')

# Fetch the second page with 5 items per page
page_2 = register.fetch(:product_index, page: 2, items: 5)
# => client.get('/products?page=2&items=5')
----

  query_params: {
    'page' => '{page}',
    'items' => '{items}'
  }
)

# Fetch the first page with 10 items per page
page_1 = register.fetch(:product_index_paginated, page: 1, items: 10)
# => client.get('/products?page=1&items=10')

# Fetch the second page with 5 items per page
page_2 = register.fetch(:product_index_paginated, page: 2, items: 5)
# => client.get('/products?page=2&items=5')

[[defining_hal_page_models]]
=== Defining HAL page models

HAL index APIs often support pagination, which allows clients to retrieve a
limited number of resources at a time.

The `Lutaml::Hal::Page` class is used to handle pagination in HAL APIs. It is a
subclass of `Resource`, and provides additional attributes and methods for
handling pagination information

The `Page` class by default supports the following attributes:

`page`:: The current page number.
`pages`:: The total number of pages.
`limit`:: The number of resources per page.
`total`:: The total number of resources.

The way to use the `Page` class is through inheritance from it, where the
class will automatically create the necessary links for typical page objects.

The typical links of a page object are:

`self`:: A link to the current page.
`prev`:: A link to the previous page.
`next`:: A link to the next page.
`first`:: A link to the first page.
`last`:: A link to the last page.

The "realize class" of these links are the same as the inherited page
object, ensuring consistency in the pagination model.

Syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
class ProductIndex < Lutaml::Hal::Page
  # No attributes necessary
end

register.add_endpoint(
  id: :product_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/products',
  model: ProductIndex
)

page_1 = register.fetch(:product_index)  # Updated to use the correct endpoint id
page_2_link = page_1.links.next
# => <#ProductIndexLink href: "/products/2", title: "Next Page">
----

Where,

`ProductIndex`:: The class of the page that will be fetched from the API. The class
must inherit from `Lutaml::Hal::Page`.
`register`:: The instance of `ModelRegister`.
`id`:: The ID of the pagination endpoint to be registered in the `ModelRegister`.
`url`:: The URL of the pagination endpoint.
`model`:: The class of the page that will be fetched from the API.




== Usage: Runtime

=== General

NOTE: The `lutaml-hal` library currently only supports synchronous data fetching.
Asynchronous data fetching will be supported in the future.

NOTE: The `lutaml-hal` library currently only supports data fetching requests
(GET) today. Additional features may be provided in the future.

Once the data definition is complete, you can use the `ModelRegister` to
fetch and interact with resources from the API.

=== Fetching a resource

The `ModelRegister` allows you to fetch resources from the API using the `fetch`
method.

NOTE: The endpoint of the resource must be already defined through the
`add_endpoint` method.

The `fetch` method will automatically handle the URL resolution and fetch the
resource from the API.

Syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
register.fetch(:resource_endpoint_id, {parameters})
----

Where,

`resource_endpoint_id`:: The ID of the endpoint registered in the
`ModelRegister`.
`parameters`:: A hash of parameters to be passed to the API. The parameters
are used to replace the interpolation parameters in the URL.
`register`:: The instance of `ModelRegister`.


.Fetch a resource directly from the API
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
product_1 = register.fetch(:product_resource, id: 1)
# => client.get('/products/1')

# => {
#   "id": 1,
#   "name": "Product 1",
#   "price": 10.0,
#   "_links": {
#     "self": { "href": "/products/1" },
#     "category": { "href": "/categories/1", "title": "Category 1" },
#     "related": [
#        { "href": "/products/3", "title": "Product 3" },
#        { "href": "/products/5", "title": "Product 5" }
#     ]
#   }
# }

product_1
# => #<Product id: 1, name: "Product 1", price: 10.0, links:
#      #<ProductLinks self: <ProductLink href: "/products/1">,
#                     category: <ProductLink href: "/categories/1", title: "Category 1">,
#                     related: [
#                         <ProductLink href: "/products/3", title: "Product 3">,
#                         <ProductLink href: "/products/5", title: "Product 5">
#                     ]}>
----
====



=== Fetching a resource index

In HAL, collections are provided via the `_links` or the `_embedded` sections of
the response.

NOTE: The `_embedded` section is not yet supported by the `Lutaml::Hal` library.

The `ModelRegister` allows you to define endpoints for collections and fetch
them using the `fetch` method.

The `fetch` method will automatically handle the URL resolution and fetch the
resource index from the API.

Syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
register.fetch(:index_endpoint_id)
----

Where,

`index_endpoint_id`:: The ID of the endpoint registered in the `ModelRegister`.
`register`:: The instance of `ModelRegister`.


.Fetch a collection of resources from the API
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
product_index = register.fetch(:product_index)
# => client.get('/products')

# => {
# "page": 1,
# "pages": 10,
# "limit": 10,
# "total": 45,
# "_links": {
#   "self": { "href": "/products/1" },
#   "next": { "href": "/products/2" },
#   "last": { "href": "/products/5" },
#   "products": [
#     { "href": "/products/1", "title": "Product 1" },
#     { "href": "/products/2", "title": "Product 2" }
#   ]
# }

product_index
# => #<ProductPage page: 1, pages: 10, limit: 10, total: 45,
#      links: #<ProductLinks self: <ProductLink href: "/products/1">,
#                     next: <ProductLink href: "/products/2">,
#                     last: <ProductLink href: "/products/5">,
#                     products: <ProductLinks
#                         <ProductLink href: "/products/1", title: "Product 1">,
#                         <ProductLink href: "/products/2", title: "Product 2">
#                     ]>>

[[fetching_resource_via_link_realization]]
=== Fetching a resource via link realization

Given a resource index that contains links to resources, the individual resource
links can be "realized" as actual model instances through the
`Link#realize(register:)` method which dynamically retrieves the resource.

Given a `Link` object, the `realize` method fetches the resource from the API
using the provided `register`.

There are two ways a resource gets realized from a `Link` object:

* If a `Lutaml::Hal::GlobalRegister` is used, and the `Link` object originated
from a fetch using a `ModelRegister` then the `realize` method has sufficient
information to automatically fetch the resource from the API using the same
`register`.
+
NOTE: This relies on the `Hal::REGISTER_ID_ATTR_NAME` attribute to be set
in the `ModelRegister` class. This attribute is used to identify the
resource endpoint ID in the URL.

* If a `GlobalRegister` is not used, even if the Link object originated
from a fetch using a `ModelRegister`, the `realize` method does not have sufficient
information to fetch the resource from the API using the same
`register`. In this case an explicit `register` must be provided to the
`realize(register: ...)` method.

Syntax for standalone usage:

[source,ruby]
----
Lutaml::Model::Link.new(
  href: 'resource_endpoint_href',
  # ... other attributes
).realize(register)
----

Where,

`resource_endpoint_href`:: The href of the resource endpoint. This is the URL of the
resource as it appears in the `_links` section of the HAL resource.
`register`:: The instance of `ModelRegister`.

The `realize` method will automatically handle the URL resolution and fetch
the resource from the API, and return an instance of the resource class
defined in the `ModelRegister` (through the endpoint definition of `realize_class`).

NOTE: It is possible to use the `realize` method on a link object using another
`ModelRegister` instance. This is useful when you want to resolve a link
using a different API endpoint or a different set of resource models.

Syntax when using a `GlobalRegister`:

[source,ruby]
----
resource_index = model_register.fetch(:resource_index)
resource_index.links.products.first.realize
# => client.get('/resources/1')
----

.Dynamically realizing a resource from the collection using links
[example]
====
[source,ruby]
----
# Without a GlobalRegister
product_2 = product_index.links.products.last.realize(register)

# With a GlobalRegister
product_2 = product_index.links.products.last.realize

# => client.get('/products/2')
# => {
#   "id": 2,
#   "name": "Product 2",
#   "price": 20.0,
#   "_links": {
#     "self": { "href": "/products/2" },
#     "category": { "href": "/categories/2", "title": "Category 2" },
#     "related": [
#        { "href": "/products/4", "title": "Product 4" },
#        { "href": "/products/6", "title": "Product 6" }
#     ]
#   }
# }

product_2
# => #<Product id: 2, name: "Product 2", price: 20.0, links:
#      #<ProductLinks self: <ProductLink href: "/products/2">,
#                     category: <ProductLink href: "/categories/2", title: "Category 2">,
#                     related: [
#                         <ProductLink href: "/products/4", title: "Product 4">,
#                         <ProductLink href: "/products/6", title: "Product 6">
#                     ]}>

# Without a GlobalRegister
product_2_related_1 = product_2.links.related.first.realize(register)

# With a GlobalRegister
product_2_related_1 = product_2.links.related.first.realize

=== Handling HAL pages / pagination

==== General

The `Lutaml::Hal::Page` class is used to handle pagination in HAL APIs.

As described in <<defining_hal_page_models>>, subclassing the `Page` class
provides pagination capabilities, including the management of links to navigate
through pages of resources.

==== Pagination navigation methods

The `Page` class provides several convenience methods for navigating through
paginated results:

`#next_page`:: Returns the next page link if available, `nil` otherwise.

`#prev_page`:: Returns the previous page link if available, `nil` otherwise.

`#first_page`:: Returns the first page link if available, `nil` otherwise.

`#last_page`:: Returns the last page link if available, `nil` otherwise.

These methods return `Link` objects that can be realized using the `realize` method:

[source,ruby]
----
# Navigate to next page
if current_page.next_page
  next_page = current_page.next_page.realize
end

# Navigate to previous page
if current_page.prev_page
  prev_page = current_page.prev_page.realize
end

# Jump to first or last page
first_page = current_page.first_page.realize if current_page.first_page
last_page = current_page.last_page.realize if current_page.last_page
----

==== Pagination helper methods

The `Page` class also provides helper methods to check the availability of
navigation links:

`#has_next?`:: Returns `true` if there is a next page available, `false`
otherwise.

`#has_prev?`:: Returns `true` if there is a previous page available, `false`
otherwise.

`#has_first?`:: Returns `true` if there is a first page link available, `false`
otherwise.

`#has_last?`:: Returns `true` if there is a last page link available, `false`
otherwise.

`#total_pages`:: Returns the total number of pages (alias for the `pages`
attribute).


==== Exhaustive pagination

For scenarios where you need to process all pages of results, you can combine
the pagination methods:

[source,ruby]
----
current_page = register.fetch(:resource_index)

while current_page
  # Process current page
  puts "Processing page #{current_page.page} of #{current_page.total_pages}"

  # Move to next page
  current_page = current_page.next
end
----


==== Usage

.Usage example of the Page class
[example]
====
Declaration:

[source,ruby]
----
class ResourceIndex < Lutaml::Hal::Page
  # No attribute definition necessary
end

register.add_endpoint(
  id: :resource_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/resources',
  model: ResourceIndex
)
----

Usage:

[source,ruby]
----
page_1 = register.fetch(:resource_index)
# => client.get('/resources')
# => {
#   "page": 1,
#   "pages": 10,
#   "limit": 10,
#   "total": 100,
#   "_links": {
#     "self": {
#       "href": "https://api.example.com/resources?page=1&items=10"
#     },
#     "first": {
#       "href": "https://api.example.com/resources?page=1&items=10"
#     },
#     "last": {
#       "href": "https://api.example.com/resources?page=10&items=10"
#     },
#     "next": {
#       "href": "https://api.example.com/resources?page=2&items=10"
#     }
#   }
# }

page_1
# => #<ResourceIndex page: 1, pages: 10, limit: 10, total: 100,
#      links: #<ResourceIndexLinks
#                self: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=1&items=10">,
#                next: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=2&items=10">,
#                last: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=10&items=10">>>

# Check if navigation is available
page_1.has_next?    # => true
page_1.has_prev?    # => false
page_1.total_pages  # => 10

# Navigate using convenience methods
page_2 = page_1.next
# => client.get('/resources?page=2&items=10')
# => #<ResourceIndex page: 2, pages: 10, limit: 10, total: 100, ...>

page_2.has_prev?    # => true
page_2.has_next?    # => true

# Navigate back to first page
first_page = page_2.first
# => client.get('/resources?page=1&items=10')

# Jump to last page
last_page = page_2.last
# => client.get('/resources?page=10&items=10')

# Alternative: using link realization (original method)
# Without a GlobalRegister
page_2 = page_1.links.next.realize(register)

# With a GlobalRegister
page_2 = page_1.links.next.realize

# => client.get('/resources?page=2&items=10')
# => #<ResourceIndex page: 2, pages: 10, limit: 10, total: 100,
#      links: #<ResourceIndexLinks
#                self: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=2&items=10">,
#                prev: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=1&items=10">,
#                next: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=3&items=10">,
#                first: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=1&items=10">,
#                last: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=10&items=10">>>,
#                prev: #<ResourceIndexLink href: "/resources?page=1&items=10">>>
