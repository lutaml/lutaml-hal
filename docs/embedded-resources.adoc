== Embedded resources

=== General

The HAL (Hypertext Application Language) specification defines two main types of
things: resources and links.

In HAL, resources are the primary objects that clients interact with, while
links provide a way to navigate between related resources.

Normally, the API access flow follows these steps:

* When fetching a resource, clients may also need to retrieve related resources,
which can result in multiple HTTP requests.

* When fetching an index of resources, clients may need to retrieve each
resource individually, leading to even more requests.

This is why HAL introduces this concept of embedded resources, which is a way to
include related resources directly within the response of a primary resource.
This way the number of HTTP requests needed to retrieve all relevant data is
reduced.

=== Types of embedded resources

Just as the above, there are two main types of embedded resources:

* related embedded resources, where the related resources included are the
content of the fetched single resource's links within the `_links` object
is provided in the `_embedded` key;

* indexed embedded resources, where the response provides an array of "links",
each corresponding link object is also provided in the `_embedded` object.

Furthermore, it is possible to have multiple levels of embedded resources,
allowing for a rich representation of related data within a single API response.

=== Implementation

The library provides comprehensive support for HAL embedded resources to reduce
HTTP requests and improve performance.

The mechanism for handling embedded resources involves these steps:

* During definition of the endpoint, indicate it supports embedding
** Specify the embedding mechanism (e.g., parameter, URL, header, auto)

* When issuing a request, indicate in the method call that embedding is desired
(e.g., `embed: true`).

* When processing the response, the library automatically extracts and makes
  embedded content available to the client.

It is important to note that not all endpoints may support embedding, and the
availability of embedded content depends on the specific API implementation.

Experimentation is almost certainly a friend.

=== Configuring embed support

Embed support is configured at the endpoint level using the `embed_config` option:

[source,ruby]
----
# Parameter-based embed (most common)
register.add_endpoint(
  id: :product_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/products',
  model: ProductIndex,
  embed_config: {
    mechanism: :parameter,
    parameter_name: 'embed',
    parameter_value: 'true'
  }
)

# URL-based embed
register.add_endpoint(
  id: :product_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/products',
  model: ProductIndex,
  embed_config: {
    mechanism: :url,
    embed_url: '/products/embed'
  }
)

# Header-based embed
register.add_endpoint(
  id: :product_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/products',
  model: ProductIndex,
  embed_config: {
    mechanism: :header,
    header_name: 'X-Embed',
    header_value: 'true'
  }
)

# Auto embed (server always provides embedded content)
register.add_endpoint(
  id: :product_index,
  type: :index,
  url: '/products',
  model: ProductIndex,
  embed_config: {
    mechanism: :auto
  }
)

=== Working with embedded resources

Resources automatically support embedded content through the `_embedded` section:

[source,ruby]
----
class ProductIndex < Lutaml::Hal::Resource
  attribute :page, :integer
  attribute :total, :integer

  hal_link :products, key: 'products', realize_class: 'Product'

  # Embedded content is automatically handled
  def has_embedded?(key)
    # Check if embedded content exists for the given key
  end

  def get_embedded(key)
    # Get embedded content for the given key
  end
end

# Fetch with embed enabled
products = register.fetch(:product_index, embed: true)

# Check for embedded content
if products.has_embedded?('products')
  embedded_products = products.get_embedded('products')
  puts "Found #{embedded_products.length} embedded products"
end

# Link resolution automatically uses embedded content when available
products.links.products.each do |product_link|
  # This will use embedded data if available, otherwise make HTTP request
  product = product_link.realize(parent_resource: products)
  puts "#{product.name} - #{product.price}"
end
----


=== Performance benefits

Using embed can significantly reduce HTTP requests:

[source,ruby]
----
# Without embed: 1 request for index + N requests for each product
products = register.fetch(:product_index)
products.links.products.each do |product_link|
  product = product_link.realize  # Each call makes an HTTP request
  puts product.name
end

# With embed: 1 request total, embedded data used automatically
products = register.fetch(:product_index, embed: true)
products.links.products.each do |product_link|
  product = product_link.realize(parent_resource: products)  # Uses embedded data
  puts product.name
end
----
